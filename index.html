        <p id="paragraph">I started coding when i'm 9 years old,i'm 4th grade.The first platform which I used to code was Code.org,I've made many apps in this platform.The second platform is Thunkable.com,I've made many apps such as chat app and cloud game.But,now i'm using brackets.Brackets is a platform used to write html.Before brackets we have used codepen.io,but we used brackets because codepen.io is not so secure and other reason is it only works when interent is there brackets can work without internet,but you can't see live preview without internet.</p>
